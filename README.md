# [ChatMedea](https://chatmedea.glitch.me/)

ChatMedea is a project that utilizes a fine-tuned Diablo GPT model based on a parsed dataset of Euripides' Medea. The project integrates the Hugging Face API and Transformers tools to enable interactive conversations with the Chat Medea chatbot.

## Description

The ChatMedea  interface is built using JavaScript and incorporates HTML and CSS for the creation of an interactive frontend. The core functionality of Chat Medea is powered by the fine-tuned Diablo GPT model, which enables engaging and context-aware conversations based on the content from Euripides' Medea.

The model used in this project has been fine-tuned by myself using a parsed dataset of Euripides' Medea, from [Ian Johnston](https://www.google.com/search?q=medea+full+text&oq=medea+full+text&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). The data was processed to train the model and enable it to generate responses in a conversational manner. A link to the model repository on HuggingFace can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/ajpieroni/DiabloGPT-medium-medea?text=Hi.)
